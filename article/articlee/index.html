As such, almost any language is suitable for a data professional to learn and use with the data they need to compute. However, certain languages lend themselves especially well for working with certain types or sources of data, or processing the data in certain ways. In this article, I’ll explain a few of those and the situations I find that they fit best</p>

                                    <p>I separate out this language since it has attributes of higher-level languages such as functions and strong data-types, but lacks richer features such as graphical interface control, complete system functions, working with objects and the like. It’s also not technically a scripting language, as it is tied to a specific “engine” for interpretation of data calls.</p>
                                    <p>SQL is a declarative language paradigm, which means you write statements describing what you want, without coding how that will end up happening on the system. This is a very simple way of starting to work with data, <br>and by layering these statements you can create very powerful constructs quickly and with just a little practice. SQL is also quite easy to read, if not a bit wordy for complex programs. <br></p>

                                    <P>In most platforms SQL statements can be sent to the server to be executed, called <font  color="red">“dynamic”</font> SQL, or stored on the server and called with a function, stored procedure or other call, which is sometimes called<font color ="color:#e36c0a;"> “server-side” </font> There are advantages and disadvantages to both, but in large part the syntax and processes are the same regardless. If you learn one, you can usually leverage most of that knowledge on the other.</P>
                                    <p> It’s important to point out that only a couple of very abstract systems use a “pure” (ANSI) form of SQL. SQL is actually quite limited in scope, and so each vendor that provides an engine uses a “dialect” of SQL. For SQL Server, which is the focus of this series, that dialect is “Transact-SQL” or T-SQ <font color="yellow"><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb510741.aspx" class=""><span>http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb510741.aspx</span> </a></font></p>

                                      <a href=""><h2>Programming Options for Interacting with Data :</h2></a>
                                    </div> 
                                    <p>As I mentioned earlier, every programming language works with data in some form. In fact, the line between scripting and programming is quite blurred –<i>Python</i>, which I’ll describe in a moment, fits squarely in both camps. For the most part, however, most programming languages are compiled, meaning they are re-written into a binary format that runs on a particular computing architecture without any <font color="#ff9800">“engine”</font> run them. A scripting language, on the other hand, requires the engine of the scripting program to interpret the statements and then run them. Even this distinction has problems, however. Java is obviously a programming language, but requires the Java engine to run. Ditto for the .NET stack from Microsoft.</p>  

                                     <p>So what are the criteria that a data professional should use for choosing a programming interface to data, then? Actually, for your lab system you shouldn’t choose at all – but use this system for its intended purpose of experimenting with everything you can. On the other hand, there is only so much time in the day, so are there clear choices for starting with a particular language? There are – and I’ve divided my criteria into the following (you may have others). The language (scripting or not) needs to have the following characteristics: <br> <I>Data-centric, or at least data-friendly, particularly as it deals with data types.</I> <BR> <i>Ability to read multiple types of data sources. </i><BR><i>Supported and popular in the data science community.</i> <BR><i>Handles large data sets.</i><BR><i>Some level of built-in visualizations</i>
                                     </p>  
                                     <p>Using those criteria, I’ll start with a brief (very brief) introduction on how programming languages interface with data and then move on to a few choices I’ve made for my system. Once again, I won’t have time for examples in this article, but I’ll provide some in the articles that follow.

                                      This is a conceptual section of this article, so stick with me for a moment. These concepts are important for the discussions that follow. Also, because I’m covering a lot of information in just a few paragraphs, I’ll lose some fidelity and exactness in the process. This isn’t intended to be a formal programming class, so feel free to add more detail in the comments if the explanations I give here strike you as incomplete, or worse, incorrect. I’ll provide several links in the References section below if you want more precise information</p>

                                      </h2></a>

                                    <p>Languages work with data by connecting to or opening a data source to take in data. That can be anything from a prompt waiting at a console for user input to reading a text file or connecting to a relational database engine.</p> 
                                    <p>I’ll use the Microsoft .NET suite of languages to frame this conversation, since the concepts diverge quickly based on the architecture you choose. In the series I’ll create on a Linux version of the data laboratory system I’ll cover other frameworks.</p>      
                                    <p>In higher-level languages that use <i>Object-Oriented programming </i>(also called Imperative programming), such as C#, whenever you work with data you create a <font color="#2196f3">“Class”</font>. A class (as it relates to data) is nothing more than a definition of some data object, such as a pizza. The definition includes a Property of the object, such as the <font color ="#2196f3">“type of pizza“</font>. Here’s a very simple example of a Pizza class:</p>     
                                     <center>
                                      <p>
                                      
                                      <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
                                        public class  &lt;Pizza <BR> { &gt;</div>
                                        <div style="text-align: justify;">
                                        </div>
                                        <div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
                                        PUBLIC String Type of Pizza &lt; {get , set } &gt;</div>
                                        <div style="text-align: justify;">
                                        </div>
                                      </p>
                                      </center>
                                      <p>With this simple definition, you can create a new Pizza by “calling” that class name in code and passing the parameters you want to insert (the set part) or read (the get part). That call does not change the Pizza class, it’s merely used to create a brand-new pizza (called an Instance) that you can name whatever you want. In essence, you use the Pizza class as a template to create a new Pizza (perhaps called Customer123Pizza) that has the value typeOfPizza=”The Works”. Pizza is still there, and now there’s another called CustomerPizza123 as well. You can work with CustomerPizza123 and change it in other ways as well, all without bothering the original Pizza.</p>
                                      <p>As a data professional, you want to work with the data in some meaningful way – usually in a tabular layout with rows and columns. But you have a Pizza object sitting there that doesn’t lend itself well to a tabular format.</p>
                                      <p>There are actually a couple of ways to handle the Object-Oriented to Tabular mismatch. In the .NET framework, you can use the ADO.NET libraries (Active Data Objects) for the change. With ADO.NET, you simply create a connection to the data you want, read the data in, work with it, and optionally write it back out again. There are connection types for everything from XML to relational database management systems.

                                      </p>

                                        You can also use<i><u> Language Integrated Query (LINQ)</u></i> to query the objects using set-based logic, because LINQ works with a hierarchy of objects – in effect, it creates a network of classes. LINQ is useful because you can work not only with relational or file or text data, but any object that has a LINQ interface. You can even join up the objects if there is some dependable key value between them.

                                      <p>Yet another method is to use<i><u> Microsoft’s Entity Framework (EF)</u></i>, which is a model-based interface to data. EF, along with other products that work in a similar way, allows you to create your data model, and it will generate the programming classes for you.</p>
                                      <p>You can use all of these methods, as well as others I have not described here, to work with data in your experiments. If it sounds complicated, don’t worry – it really isn’t. As you experiment on your system you’ll find that each has strengths and weaknesses for any given type of data or processing need. You should become familiar with all of them in a test environment so that you know when to use each.</p>

                                    <p>Scripting languages are also useful for the data professional. I’ve already covered the installation of PowerShell, the Microsoft scripting language. Like F#, one of the advantages to working with data in PowerShell is that you have the full range of the .NET libraries.</p>

                                    <p>In addition to PowerShell, several other scripting candidates exist for working with data. But one stands out for the data professional: Python. Python was predominantly used in web-based applications, where the web page served as the user interface and Python performed the computation work. As time passed, Python became a very rich scripting language due to two primary factors: it’s easy to learn, and many people wrote “libraries” or pre-defined functions that made it quick to implement to solve a problem. Those two factors also made it the go-to language for today’s data scientists. It allowed them to quickly leverage other scientist’s work in a relatively powerful simple to learn language. That means it meets the criteria of a large, supported, community install base.</p>     
                                    <p>Python is not only a scripting language, but fits well with the OO programming paradigm. This power, along with the fact that it runs on multiple operating systems and is an open-source project cements its choice for the data laboratory system’s toolbox</p>     
                                    <p>There are two primary versions of Python – 2 and Python 3. The 2.7 and earlier versions of Python didn’t work well in certain situations, but weren’t easily changed because so many libraries referenced it. A wholesale upgrade in version 3 brought Python up to modern standards, but also caused a fairly significant problem. Because so many libraries were written to version 2 and wouldn’t work in version 3, people were reluctant to switch to the new version. Python became a victim of its own success.</p>
